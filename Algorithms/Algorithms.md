An algorithm is a set of instructions to accomplish a certain task

##Search Algorithm

Search algorithms are used to check if a certain value is present in the data structure.


**Simple Search**

Simple search is a dumb algorithm and works by checking every item in the array/data structure to see if it matches the value we are looking for.

**Binary Search**

Binary Search is smarter than Simple Search. But it only works on arrays that are already sorted. It splits the array into two by checking the middle element. If the value to be searched is bigger than the middle element, the lower half of the array is discarded (and vice versa). The process continues until the value is found or there are no more values left to search.
